# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis-
Classify the given genetic variations/Mutation based on evidence from text-based literature.
The following Problem is a Case study on Cancer Diagnosis Problem
Taken From Kaggle.
In an effort to maximize the potential of personalized medicine, Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) launched this competition, which
was accepted into the NIPS 2017 Competition Track.
Once Patients seem to have some problem they take a cancer tumor from
patients and we go through genetic sequencing of DNA.Once sequenced,
a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the
challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor
growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).
Till now it has been done Manually which takes lots of time and effort.
Genetic Mutation : A sudden or small change is someone's genes which
may result in a cancer tumor.
Every gene has an ID(name) and variation associated with it and based on
that we can perform classification of each and every gene.Every gene and
its corresponding variations is classified into 9 different classes some of
the 9 classes may correspond to a cancer tumor.
